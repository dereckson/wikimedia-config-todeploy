Config to deploy script
=======================

(c) 2015, 2016,  SÃ©bastien Santoro aka Dereckson
Released under BSD license.

This script reads the Wikimedia-Site-Requests project board on Phabricator
and queries Gerrit to get information about open changes.

It then prints the lines of changes to deploy, ready to add to our wiki page
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deployments.

To run it, `./todeploy` or `php todeploy.php`.

To customize it, start by the $config array around line 10 of this file.

Q. Can I use it for other software?

* If you use Bugzilla or other bug tracker with Gerrit, get an array with the
  bug number, and pass it to the ChangesToDeploy constructor.

* If you use purely Phabricator, keep the PhabricatorBoardScraper part and then
  check for every task if an accepted differential is attached with a call to
  maniphest.gettasktransactions Phabricator API.
  
* If you use Phabricator, then another product, the PhabricatorBoardScraper 
  GetTasksId method will give you an array of the tasks to deploy. You need
  a reference into your product to these tasks. Then query your application.
